CGN14 is confirmed for Monday 5th December at our regular venue, the Cambridge Union. Arrive from 7pm for drinks, with talks starting at 7:30.

Our two main talks are confirmed as:

* A talk by [Mazz Mosley](http://twitter.com/mnowster), a female developer, on the 12 things she'd like from her tech community. There won't be a partridge in a pear tree or a pink pony in sight. Gleaned from 9 years of development experience here's 12 things *you* can do to help make the tech industry a better place, not just for women, but for _everyone_! Who doesn't want to be more awesome?
* [Duncan MacGregor](http://twitter.com/aardvark179), a lead software engineer working for General Electric on compilers and run-time systems will be speaking on "Dynamic languages & Java 7". The latest version of the JVM has added several features which make it a very attractive target for running languages that aren't Java, especially dynamic languages. Why would you want to port a language to run on the JVM, how can you do it, and what's still to come that will make things even better.
