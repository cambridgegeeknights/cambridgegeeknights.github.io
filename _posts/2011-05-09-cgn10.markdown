CGN10 is now confirmed for May 9th 2011, 7pm at the Cambridge Union.

Our main speaker is David Buxton from [Arachnys](http://www.arachnys.com), with a talk titled "Google App Engine - Experiences from the trenches".
There will be a response to this talk at <a href="/events/cgn11">CGN11</a> by Michael Brunton-Spall.

**Update**:
After the talks a few people stayed behind to discuss the future of Cambridge Geek Nights. A lightning talk will explain the conclusions at CGN11, but in summary:

* Events should be every 2 months
* Two main talks of 15-20 mins plus questions, and a few lightning talks is about right
* Talks will be kept to their timings in future, including sponsor talks
