CGN#6 will be held at 7:30pm on Monday 8th November (arrive from 7pm to take advantage of the bar tab), sponsored by [Cambridge Consultants](http://www.cambridgeconsultants.com).
We are once again at The Cambridge Union (9a Bridge Street, Cambridge).

This month we have 2 main speakers:

* Richard Pope will be speaking about [ScraperWiki.com](http://scraperwiki.com)
* After a postponement from speaking at CGN#5, Vero Pepperrell will tell the story of Alfred ([http://alfredapp.com](http://alfredapp.com)), a Mac productivity app launched in March, sharing some observations on how the community has grown & how you might apply this to your own project or app.

As we only have 2 main speakers this month weâ€™re looking for some of you to get involved by giving lightning talks. We already have one confirmed from our sponsor, Cambridge Consultants, but need approx 3 more.
