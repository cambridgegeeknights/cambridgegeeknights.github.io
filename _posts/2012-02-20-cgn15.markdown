Also speaking will be [Gareth Rushgrove](http://www.morethanseven.net/), who works as an in-house developer and server wrangler for the new [Government Digital Service](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/). He will be discussing his experiences with agile development with a talk titled “What worked and what we would change about how we built [GOV.UK](http://gov.uk)”.

We will also have a lighting talk from Laura Newman and Peter Murray-Rust on open science and the Panton Fellowship.
