## What are Cambridge Geek Nights?

Cambridge Geek Nights are get-togethers of geeks from in and around the Cambridge area. We meet up every couple of months, discuss all things tech, have a couple of drinks, and generally geek out of an evening.

Events are free to attend, with no need to register, just turn up on the night. We usually also have a drinks sponsor who puts up a bar tab to ensure your first couple of drinks are free!

The idea for the event is based directly on the wildly successful [Oxford Geek Nights](http://oxford.geeknights.net), so many thanks for them for letting us <del>shamelessly pilfer</del> <ins>use</ins> the idea.
